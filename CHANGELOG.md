# 6.0.0

This update primarily adds documentation and fixes some long-standing bugs
and inefficiencies. Due to the code required for the documentation, the yaml
specification needed to change; thus this is a breaking change and will require
configuration updates when moving from older versions.

New Features
- Reference-level readmes: these specify high-level information such as a
  summary of the contained stratifications for the given reference, the workflow
  used to generate the stratifications, data use policies, etc. Copies of these
  can also be found in the tarballs. Since these tarballs may be downloaded
  individually, the documentation for each reference is meant to be
  self-contained.
- Stratification level readmes: Similar to the above, each stratification
  directory (ie Functional, GCcontent, etc) now has a readme with a description
  of the contained stratification bed files as well as the methods used to
  create them. The methods section includes provenance information, including
  the urls and hashes for files that were obtained remotely, as well as software
  versions.
- a "big bed flag" which will produce corresponding .bb files for each .bed.gz
  file (and tarball them)
- "hap1" and "hap2" are now called "pat" and "mat"
  
Bug fixes:
- bed files produced from GFF files (or anything else 1-indexed) are no longer
  off by one in their start/end coordinates

Breaking changes (in the yaml config):
- vcf files are now specified with the 'vcf' key and not a 'bed' key (for
  obvious reasons)
- other_strats bed files have a new structure to accomodate the 'description'
  keyword which will be used when constructing the readmes
- bed files and coordinates now take 'provenance' and 'description'
- the bed coords object has been simplified since it doesn't require a 'params'
  key
- the keys "hap1" and "hap2" are now called "pat" and "mat" in all cases
- misc bed file categories can now take descriptions

# 5.0.0

Pipeline now works on diploid genomes. This is a major release and many previous
configuration options will totally break due to the way the yaml file needed to
be represented for the diploid case. However, the output for the haploid case
should not change.

Also added a new stratification group "Diploid" which contains heterozygous and
homozygous regions between two diploid haplotypes.

Other new features:

- validation now includes intra-chromosomal coverage plots showing the coverage
  of each bed file within 1Mbp windows
- bed files can now be specified directly in the yaml config
- bigbeds can now be imported directly
- numerous speed and memory improvements; most rules will now run in constant
  memory, and those that don't can be allocated more memory on a per-build basis
  using the "malloc" directive in yaml

Other breaking changes:

- In the yaml config, there are now three toplevel stratification categories
  corresponding to "haploid" (self explanatory), "diploid1" (two haplotypes in
  one diploid bed file/fasta), or "diploid2" (one haplotype per bed/fasta
  diploid pair). In the latter two cases, the 1 or 2 designates how the final
  stratification beds will be split (ie into one file or two files).
  Furthermore, the two diploid configurations can take either diploid1 or
  diploid2 beds as input (they will be split/combined as needed), which makes
  the configuration very flexible but also more complex. See
  `config/testing.yaml` for examples.
- CDS regions no longer require the "feature table" file; instead use the
  chromosomal pattern directly to map chromosome accession numbers in the GFF to
  chromosomal indices

# 4.1.1

- remove extra tarball parent directories
- fix comment line skipping when reading bed files
- don't make validation directory hidden
- remove extra static config

# 4.1.0

- automatically derive vdj regions from refseq

# 4.0.0

- allow custom chromosome mappings (to deal with the HG2 paternal asms having
'chrX_MATERNAL' and vice versa)

# 3.0.0

- generalize chr prefix into a pattern (to allow recognizing chromosome names
  like "chr1_PATERNAL")
- relax constraints in input files; if not provided, output will not be
  generated; this is useful for cases where the input files do not exist.
  - affected strats: low complexity, xy, functional

# 2.10.0

- add AT/GC to low complexity just for homopolymers
- add AT/GC low complexity to benchmark output

# 2.7.0

- make small rules not run on slurm
- fix lots of errors involving the final list of strats (actually involved using

  run previously)
